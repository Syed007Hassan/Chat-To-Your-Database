## Introduction

Natural language querying allows users to interact with databases more intuitively and efficiently. By leveraging the power of LangChain, SQL Agents, and OpenAIâ€™s Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, we have created an application that enables users to query databases using NLP. All it needs a SQL-based schema, and it can perform any read and write action to that schema.

This is an experimental app to test the abilities of LLMs to query SQL databases using [SQL Agents](https://github.com/Syed007Hassan/Langchain) provided by Langchain.
To use it, you should have an OPENAI_API_KEY.

## Features
- Auto-generate SQL queries from the natural language descriptions
- Translate SQL queries from one dialect to another
- Optimize SQL queries to make them run faster
- Analyze SQL queries to identify potential problems
- Optimize the SQL queries that are used to fetch data from the SQL database
- Analyze the SQL queries that are used in your NextJS application to identify potential problems
- Displays all the data in the form of a table after executing the query on a schema
- Stores the history prompts and the queries generated in No-SQL

## Examples 

### Sample database SQLite

  * **Backend**: ExpressJS/NestJS
  * **Databases**: Sqlite/PostgreSQL/MongoDB
  * **LLM**: Langchain SQL Agent with Open AI LLM

## Getting Started

### Add Env file 

After cloning the repo, change the directory to nest_api, and add a **.env** file.

```bash!
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxx
# Docker environment variables
DB_TYPE=postgres
PG_HOST=postgres
PG_USER=postgres
PG_PASSWORD=postgres
PG_DB=postgres
PG_PORT=5432
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
POSTGRES_DB=postgres
PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL=admin@pgadmin.com
PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=admin
MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=root
MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=pass12345
MONGO_URL=mongodb://root:pass12345@mongodb:27017/chatwithdb?authSource=admin
PORT=5000
```
### Running the APP using Docker Compose with your own Database (PostgreSQL)

- Build the image using
  **```  docker-compose build --no-cache  ```**
- Run Container with the build image
  **``` docker-compose up ```**

     ![image](https://github.com/Syed007Hassan/NextJs-Langchain-Agents-SQL/assets/104893311/42c9a960-d5df-4de1-b159-fa0dbcdf8c96)
  
- Open PgAdmin to upload your Database (I will use ***.tar** file to upload the whole database, you could use any method, and just remember to name the database as mentioned in **.env**. In my case it is **postgres**)
- On **``` localhost:5050 ```**, login to PgAdmin

- Create a server group
  
     ![image](https://github.com/Syed007Hassan/NextJs-Langchain-Agents-SQL/assets/104893311/29cadd3e-d232-479f-aa81-646b4a996bb9)
 
- Then register server

- Now restore the database to upload the file

- After restoring, all the tables will be shown

- Run the frontend after changing the directory to the client and then using **``` npm run dev ```**, available at **``` localhost:3000 ```**
- Register and then Sign-in, the application will be redirected towards  **```/chat```** URL
- According to your schema write any prompt to generate an SQL query and the results database contains
