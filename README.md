## Introduction

Natural language querying allows users to interact with databases more intuitively and efficiently. By leveraging the power of LangChain, SQL Agents, and OpenAIâ€™s Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, we have created an application that enables users to query databases using NLP. All it needs a SQL-based schema, and it can perform any read and write action to that schema.

This is an experimental app to test the abilities of LLMs to query SQL databases using [SQL Agents](https://github.com/Syed007Hassan/Langchain) provided by Langchain.
To use it, you should have an OPENAI_API_KEY.

## Features
- Auto-generate SQL queries from the natural language descriptions
- Translate SQL queries from one dialect to another
- Optimize SQL queries to make them run faster
- Analyze SQL queries to identify potential problems
- Optimize the SQL queries that are used to fetch data from the SQL database
- Analyze the SQL queries that are used in your NextJS application to identify potential problems
- Displays all the data in the form of a table after executing the query on a schema
- Stores the history prompts and the queries generated in No-SQL

## Examples

## Getting Started

### Add Env file 

In nest_api folder, add a **.env** file.

```bash!
DB_NAME=
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_SCHEMA=
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxx
MONGODB_URI=
```
### Installing the APP

```bash!
cd nest_api
npm install
```

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

### Running the APP

```bash
/nest_api
npm run start:dev
/client
npm run dev
```
